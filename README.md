# FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP
This is a copy of the FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP library that I use in my private projects. 

Please use the official sources found [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/tree/master/libraries/freertos_plus/standard/freertos_plus_tcp)

The network interfaces in this private repo may run ahead of the ones find in the public repo.
